                "Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to
                its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written
                code. But it doesn’t have to be that way."

                <blockquote>Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving very fast at the beginning of a
                    project can find themselves moving at a snail’s pace. Every change they make to the code breaks two
                    or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial. (...) As the mess builds, the productivity
                    of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.

                    we didn’t learn anything since.
